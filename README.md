# Yeti React Challenge

> **Before you start**:
> You need to have some familiriarity with Javascript and full-stack development to be fully comfortable doing this challenge. Here it is a guide to get to know our day to day in the Yeti team https://trello.com/b/znIqnzVK/engineering-path

## Create a GitHub app with React Native

The idea is to prove that you can create a fully featured app, using git as version control. You'll need to create it using React Native https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html (preferably using the guide "create projects with native code")
